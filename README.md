- 👋 Hi, I’m @akbntsio
- 👀 I’m interested in signal processing like speech, and interested in other technologies like IoT, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently engaged in enbedded software development.
- 💞️ I have a signal viewing and analysis software that I had made in 90's.
   Recently I maintained to use it and surprisingly I find it valuable even now for me. 
   Then I thought I’d like to share it first of all.
